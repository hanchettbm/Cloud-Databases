# Overview
**Description:**  
This software allows the user to interact with a cloud database by inputing and updating information that will be stored in Google's Firebase cloud database. It is written to allow users to create a virtual cloud calendar that they can access, change, remove, and store events in. All data is stored in the database. Each user has a username and password that gives them access to only their information. The calendar data pulled from the database displays in list format for easy viewing. 

**Purpose:**  
My purpose for writing this software is to demonstrate the use and capabilities of cloud databases, to learn more myself, and also to create a practical program where database storage is useful. It is useful to store important dates and information that is calendar and event related in the cloud for access anywhere and for storage backup and saftey to protec important info.

# Cloud Database

The cloud database I am using is Google's Firebase database. It is a No SQL free database that allows for online storage of collections, documents, and files. 

I created a firebase structure with three collections, Users, Events, and Calendars. The user collection stores a document with the user's username and password. The Calendars Collecion holds documents with the names of the calendars the user created, and then each Calender name document holds that person's username and password as a Calendar ID. Lastly the Events Collection stores documents labeled by their date, and each date holds the events the user set under that date. It also holds the username and password of who the events belong to, and then the Calender ID. All of these can be refrenced to pull the correct user calendar info together to display.

# Development Environment

The tools that I used to develop the software were Google's Firebase database, with a free service account, and JSON file access key. I connected to this using Python version 3.9.1 in Visual Studio Code, and uploaded to GitHub using Git.

* Firebase
* Visual Studio Code
* GitHub

The programming language that I used was Python version 3.9.1. I used the git library, as well as the firebase library.

# Future Work

* Ordering results pulled from database by:
    * Date
    * Time
    * Alphabetical
* Unique autogenerated Calendar and Date ID's
* Fix Bug where Curent Calendar ID gets overwritted with new one when adding event on same day.
